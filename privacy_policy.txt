Hello,

None of my apps make any direct attempts at storing or using personal data.
Neither are they ad supported, so please just uninstall if you feel you are
being intruded on. Or you can even just directly look through the source code
yourself to verify this if you wish. All of my apps are licensed to the public
domain, so their code belongs to you just as much as it belongs to me.

If there is any data collection happening, this is through 3rd party libraries
that are outside of my control. Please use common sense when submitting data
to my apps. However, none of my apps even have a form for you to submit any
data to anyway.

Also note that all of my apps are just personal projects. There is no money in
any of this.

Thanks, I hope you enjoy using my app(s).
Charles Madere
